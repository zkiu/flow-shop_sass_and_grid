# flower-shop

This website is inspired by my friend's wish to have a side business selling flower arrangements. I hope that getting my friend's (Bill's) collaboration on this project will inspire him to finally make his dream into reality. The page's layout is done using just CSS with a 12-column layout to create a response webpage. The html code is cleaner as compared to the many div tags necessary by more popular style frameworks, such as Bootstrap.
