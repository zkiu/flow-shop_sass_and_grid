# flower-shop
A webpage is coded using HAML (HTML abstraction markup language), and SASS (CSS extension language with the Compass framework). The page's layout is done using just CSS with a 12-column layout to create a response webpage Without using a framework, the code is cleaner as compared to the code generated by more popular layout frameworks, such as Bootstrap.

This website is inspired by my friend's wish to have a side business selling flower arrangements. I hope that getting my friend's (Bill's) collaboration on this project will inspire him to finally make his dream into reality.
